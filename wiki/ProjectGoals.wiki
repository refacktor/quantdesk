The project's long-term goals include:
  * Producing easy-to-use applications. The software should be usable by people other than the developers themselves.
  * Producing easy-to-use libraries. The software should be easy to extend and modify by those who wish to do so.
  * Compatibility with data sources and file formats commonly available to retail investors.
  * Support for popular retail investment vehicles such as Stocks, Mutual Funds, ETFs, Bonds, and Options.
  * Support for U.S. markets and exchanges.
  * Collecting best-of-breed open-source components under the umbrella of one fully integrated package.
  * Investment-oriented analytics.

We also have some anti-goals:
  * Anything that requires special access to the exchanges, or anything else not commonly available to a retail investor.
  * Institutional investment vehicles such as futures, CMOs, CDOs, over-the-counter options, etc.
  * Day-Trading, or High-Frequency Trading.
